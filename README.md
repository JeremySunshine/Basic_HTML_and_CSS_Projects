# Basic_HTML_and_CSS

This repositoriy is for my projects from my Basic HTML and CSS class at The Tech Academy.

Here you will find some of the very first code I have written.

Several projects included are one page website, html tables/lists, css roollover menu, and other css styling.

The Markup languages that were used were HTML and CSS.
